# Static
This folder contains all static files that are served by the website. Any CSS, images, or javascript goes into their respecitve folders here.

Flask automatically knows this file path is the source for any static files, so they must go here.

`style.css` is the default stylesheet that is sourced in `base.html`. 

`db_icon.ico` is the image that appears as the website icon on the tab. 

`script.js` contains all javascript functions/actions that are triggered by HTML
elements.
